Welcome! I am a Senior Data & Applied Scientist at Microsoft. My current work focuses on ranking, recommendation system, augmented reality, and geospatial services. I earned my Ph.D in Computational Mechanics, Master in Machine Learning, and Master in Civil Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.

I believe in the benefits of interdisciplinary studies and thus have expanded my interests to multiple areas from engineering to theorical science. My work has been published or is forthcoming in SIGKDD, Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, Quaterly Applied Mathematics, and Liquid Crystals.
